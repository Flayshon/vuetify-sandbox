# Vuetify sandbox

This repo contains a Laravel application (deployed with Docker Compose) with Vuetify set up. It's being used as a sandbox to test some of the components provided by [dayspan-calendar](https://github.com/ClickerMonkey/dayspan-vuetify).

The results of this experiment will be used to finish implementing [scheduly's frontend](https://github.com/Flayshon/scheduly).
